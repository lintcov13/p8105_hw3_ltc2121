## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Each row represents a
single product from an instacart order.In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

There are a total of 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
having the most items ordered from compared to all other aisles.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609

    ## # … with 124 more rows

Here is a plot which shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
starting with aisles that have at least 1000 items ordered from them.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() + 
    labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

This table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`
, and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n)))  %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

This table shows the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and
Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week in a format that is
easy for viewing.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "minute", 
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    activity_count = round(activity_count, 2), 
    day_type = ifelse(day == "Friday", "weekend", 
                     ifelse(day == "Saturday", "weekend", 
                            ifelse(day == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday"))), 
  minute = as.numeric(minute), 
  day_type = as.factor(day_type))

This dataset contains 50400 rows and 6 columns. Each row shows a
distinct `activity count` for a given `minute` throughout a given `day`
starting at midnight. The dataset spans over 5 weeks and includes 35
days of activity monitoring. The dataset also contains a variable that
describes if the day constitutes as a weekend or a weekday.

``` r
activity_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarise(total_activity = 
              sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  mutate(total_activity = round(total_activity, 0)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = day, values_from = total_activity ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the

``` r
######## arrange(desc(total_activity)) %>% ######## if using long data #### if not REMOVE !!
# 
```

The table above shows the total activity count for each day of the week.
From this table you are able to see some general trends in activity. It
seems like Saturday’s are notably days with lower activity count, while
Friday’s seem to have higher activity counts.

``` r
activity_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes( x = minute, y = activity_count, color = day)) + 
  geom_point( alpha = .5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Activity during the Day by Day of the Week",
    x = "Hours of the Day",
    y = "Activity Count") + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 360, 720, 1080, 1440), 
    labels = c("0", "6", "12", "18", "24"))
```

The graph above shows the activity count over the 24 hour day for each
day in the dataset. The graph is grouped by day of the week. The graph
shows that this individual typically starts their day around 7th-8th
hour of the day. It is seen through outlying point that this person is
more typical to have deviate from their average activity level on the
weekend days. They typically have an increase in activity level between
the 20th-22nd hour of the day, especially on Friday’s.

## Problem 3

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

This dataset contains 2595176 rows and 7 columns. Each observation in
the dataset is an individual daily reading from one of the New York
state weather stations. The weather station readings were taken from
1981-01-01 to 2010-12-31. The variables key measured from the weather
station are precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum temperature,
and minimum temperature. There is a notable amount of missing data since
not all of the weather stations measure each variable. In total, there
are 3387623 missing values out of 12975880 values combined from all of
the measured variables in the dataset.
